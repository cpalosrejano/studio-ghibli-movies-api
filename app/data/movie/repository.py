The Witch of the Waste misinterprets the nature of the relationship between the two and casts a spell on Sophie, transforming her into a withered ninety-year-old woman.

Feisty old Sophie shakes the house up, with much more pep than she had as her original younger self. What will Sophie do, and what will happen between her and Howl?",
